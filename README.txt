Improvements: 1\ Adjust test.py and train.py to accommodate vanilla lstm-> vlstm_train.py, vlstm_test.py
              2\ Adjust optimizer
              3\ reimplementing model.py and vlstm_model.py
              4\ Add Animation.py


TRAINING WITH SOCIAL LSTM:
run train.py
run test.py

TRAINING WITH VANILLA LSTM
run VLSTM_train.py
run VLSTM_tets.py

MAKE VIDEO:
Animation.py
